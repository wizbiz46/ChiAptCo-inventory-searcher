# Chicago Apartment Co. Inventory Searcher

Mobile-friendly static web app inspired by the Chicago Apartment Co. Field Ops / Media + Partner Tracker UI.

## Filters

- Bed count
- Bath count
- Neighborhood

## Data source

The static app expects a Google Apps Script endpoint that returns Inventory LIVE rows:

```json
{ "ok": true, "data": { "units": [] } }
```

Use `apps-script/Code.gs`, deploy it as a Web App, then paste the `/exec` URL into the app Settings drawer.

Inventory LIVE sheet ID is prefilled in the Apps Script:
`1THzRvETIeCVzPmc81LXFQ7MmyksmRfqunTNhMlu_N3s`
